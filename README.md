# Exploratory Data Analysis of Defects in Manufacturing
This project involves an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a dataset, which records the number of defects in a manufacturing or production process over a 10-day period. The primary focus of this analysis is to identify insights that could be interesting for improvements. 

## Objectives 
- To analyze the defect data for consistency and completeness.
- To understand the distribution and variation of defects over time.
- To uncover daily and hourly trends in defect occurrence.
- To provide actionable insights that could help in process optimization.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
